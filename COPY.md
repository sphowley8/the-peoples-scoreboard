# Core Thesis

## Consumer Spending Is the Real Lever of Power

- The most direct way to influence corporate behavior is through **consumer spending**
- CEOs and shareholders are accountable to **revenue, growth, and market cap**
- Protests, petitions, and social media campaigns create noise — but revenue changes create consequences
- When consumer behavior shifts, it shows up in:
  - Earnings reports
  - Subscriber counts
  - Forward guidance
  - Stock price movement

---

# Why This Strategy Works

## Earnings Reports Are Where Pressure Becomes Real

- Public companies are judged quarter-by-quarter
- Even a **1% miss in projected market cap or earnings expectations** can trigger **5%+ stock price declines**
- Stock drops affect:
  - Executive compensation (often stock-based)
  - Investor confidence
  - Board oversight pressure
- When cancellations scale, they translate into visible financial signals

---

## Why Most Boycotts Fail

### 1. The Signal Is Invisible
- Individual cancellations are not aggregated
- Executives cannot distinguish between churn and coordinated action
- No centralized reporting means no measurable pressure

### 2. They Don’t Last
- Outrage fades
- Participation drops
- Without continuity, companies wait out the storm

# What This Site Solves

- Aggregates cancellations into visible, measurable signals
- Transforms individual actions into collective economic pressure
- Makes participation persistent rather than temporary
- Tracks and reports unsubscribe impact in real time

# The Power of Subscription Cancellations

## Recurring Revenue Compounds Impact

- Subscriptions are recurring revenue streams
- A cancellation today affects:
  - This month’s revenue
  - Every future month’s revenue
- A February cancellation still impacts September earnings
- When multiplied across thousands of users, the compounding effect becomes material

# Movement Momentum

## This Is Already Working

- Estimated **$260 million in market cap impact** already attributed to tracked unsubscribes
- This demonstrates:
  - Collective action scales
  - Financial pressure is measurable
  - Market response is real

---

## How the $260M Estimate Is Calculated

1. Track total confirmed subscription cancellations
2. Estimate average annual revenue per subscriber (ARPU)
3. Calculate projected recurring revenue lost
4. Apply conservative revenue-to-valuation multiples typical for subscription businesses
5. Estimate corresponding reduction in market capitalization

> Example Framework:
> - X cancellations × Y annual subscription value x 12 months in a year = AAR Lost
> - AAR Lost × 10 (industry standard multiple for market cap) = Estimated market cap impact

This provides a transparent, conservative model for estimating shareholder-level pressure.
